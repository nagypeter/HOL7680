##  HOL7680: Easy Migration: On-Premises Oracle WebLogic to Oracle Java Cloud Service  ##

### About this tutorial ###
In this use case you have a JEE5 application running on top of a Weblogic 10.3.6 installation and you want to migrate to Oracle Public Cloud Service using Java Cloud Service's AppToCloud feature. Oracleâ€™s AppToCloud infrastructure allows you to export an existing domain configuration and Java applications, and to then provision a new Oracle Java Cloud Service instance with the same domain resources and applications. See the diagram which shows the on premise and the migrated architecture. The migration is completely done by Oracle's AppToCloud feature and requires minimal intervetion to achive the migration to the cloud.

![](images/app2cloud.arhitecture.png)

This tutorial demonstrates how to:
  
+ export on premise Weblogic 10.3.6 domain including application bits using App2Cloud tool,
+ create Java Cloud Service instance using Oracle Java Cloud Service's AppToCloud function
+ import application running and exported as part of the on premise Weblogic 10.3.6 production domain.

### Steps ###

#### Create Weblogic 10.3.6 domain and deploy the Petstore sample application ####
Open a terminal and change to `/u01/content/cloud-native-devops-workshop/app-2-cloud` folder.

	$ [oracle@localhost Desktop]$ cd /u01/content/cloud-native-devops-workshop/app-2-cloud
	
Run the `runOnPremWLS.10.3.6.sh` script which starts the database, creates Weblogic 10.3.6 domain, starts Weblogic servers and deploys the Petstore demo application.

    $ [oracle@localhost app-2-cloud]$ ./runOnPremWLS.10.3.6.sh
	  Oracle database (sid: XE) is running.
	  Open pluggable database: PDBORCL.
    PDBORCL is already opened

Now check the Petstore demo application. Open a browser and enter *http://localhost:7003/petstore/faces/catalog.jsp* URL to hit the application.

![](images/on.prem.petstore.png)

Note in the virtualbox environment there is no load balancer configured for the cluster which contains 2 managed servers. The 7003 and 7004 port are the direct access to the managed servers. 

#### Export the domain and database ####

In this step a prepared script will complete the following steps:

1. App2Cloud tool checks the health of the running WebLogic domain created in the previous step.
2. After the healthcheck export the domain including the custom deployments and upload to the Oracle Public Cloud Storage container.
3. Export and import the on-premise database to the Oracle Public Cloud Database Service.

The database export/import in this simplified case means the sample SQL script upload and execution which prepares the Oracle Public Cloud Database Service.

Now run the `exportAndUploadWLS.10.3.6.Domain.sh` to check, export the existing domain and prepare the Oracle Public Database Cloud Service. Because the script will interact the assigned Oracle Public Cloud Services you need to provide the credentials and identity domain allocated to you by the instructor:

After the successful export you are ready to create an Oracle Java Cloud Service instance.

#### Creating an Oracle Java Cloud Service Instance with AppToCloud ####

In order to import your source domain configuration and applications into Oracle Java Cloud Service, you must associate a new service instance with the files that you previously generated with the AppToCloud tools.

Most of the steps that you use to create a service instance with AppToCloud are the same as those you use to create a standard service instance. However, there are some additional steps:

- You must provide the location of your AppToCloud JSON file on Oracle Storage Cloud Service.
- You must associate each Data Source in your original WebLogic Server domain with an existing Oracle Database Cloud - Database as a Service database deployment.

Open a browser and sign in to [Oracle Public Cloud Services](https://cloud.oracle.com/sign-in). 
Select *Traditional Cloud Account* type and the datacenter where your services are available. Oracle Public Cloud Services details are given by the instructor.
Click **My Services**.
![](images/01.select.datacenter.png)

Enter the name of the identity domain. Click **Go**.
![](images/02.identity.domain.png)

Provide the username and password and click **Sign In**.
![](images/03.username.password.png)

On the dashboard click the menu on the top left corner. The list of services will fly in from the left. Select **Java**.

On the Java Cloud Service Details page complete the necessary fields.

- Service name: **petstore**
- Description: optional.
- SSH public key. Click the **Edit** button to open the SSH public key dialog and select the **Create a New Key** option. In this case the key will be generated for you what you need to download. Download anywhere you want the key is not needed in the lab.
- Enable access to Administration Consoles: enable.
- Shape: use the default, small instance.
- Username: Weblogic administrator username. For example: *weblogic*
- Password: Weblogic administrator password. For example: *welcome1*
- Cluster size: leave the 2 which is based on the JSON configuration file.
- Cloud Storage container: the path of the container to store backup and configuration related to this Java Cloud Service. Name it to `petstore`. Format is: `Storage-<IDENTITY_DOMAIN>/petstore`.
- Cloud Storage Username: name of a cloud user that has access to this storage container.
- Cloud Storage Password: password of a cloud user that has access to this storage container.
- Create Cloud Storage Container: enable to create the container defined above for Java Cloud Service.
- Database: Database Cloud Service for required schema. As we recommended use the same what was prepared previously for Petstore demo application.
- Database Administrator Username: **sys**.
- Database Password: the password of Database Administrator which is *Welcome_1*.
- PDB Name: leave *Default* which is usually PDB1.
- Provision Load Balancer: Yes.
- Load Balancer details: leave the default.

On the **Additional Service Details** screen, select the first **Application Data Source**: *PETSTORE*. Complete the following parameters:

- DBCS Instance: select the Database Cloud Service DBCS Instance for Petstore application and which was also selected to host JRF required schemas on the previous screen.
- Username: **petstore**. This data source will connect to the database as this user.
- Password: the password of Database Administrator. If you have not changed the value in the `environment.properties` then it is *Welcome_1*. (The script has set the same password for **petstore** schema.)
- PDB: leave the **default**.

Click **OK** to accept your changes. Click **Next**.

You can use the **Activity** tab to monitor the progress and status of the creation of your service instance. After your service instance is provisioned and is running, you are ready to import the AppToCloud artifacts into the service instance.

#### Importing Applications into a Service Instance ####

After creating an AppToCloud service instance in Oracle Java Cloud Service, perform an import to automatically update the service instance with the applications and other domain resources collected from your on-premises environment.

Locate the AppToCloud service instance that you created previously. Click the hamburger Menu icon adjacent to the service instance name and select **AppToCloud Import**.
![](images/21.jcs.ready.png)

When prompted for confirmation, click **Yes**.
![](images/22.confirm.app.import.png)

Monitor the progress of the import with the Activity tab. After a successful import, the applications and other domain resources found in your source domain are deployed to your service instance.

To check the Petstore application deployed on Java Cloud Service first we need to get the public IP address of the Load Balancer. Click on the **petstore** Java Cloud Service.
![](images/22.petstore.instance.png)

Note the Public IP of the Load Balancer.
![](images/23.lb.ip.png)

Open a browser and enter the Public IP address of the Load Balancer and append `/petstore/faces/catalog.jsp` to hit the application. The URL should look like this: `http://140.86.0.54/petstore/faces/catalog.jsp`. Don't forget to use your Load Balancer's IP address.
